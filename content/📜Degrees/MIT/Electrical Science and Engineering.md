At least _one_ of your completed subjects must be from the [[../../🗃️Groups/MIT/II|II]]
At least _one_ of your completed subjects must be from the [[../../🗃️Groups/MIT/PROB|PROB]]

#### Notes

Instead of the original "introductory subject" and "[[6.UAT Oral Communication | 6.UAT]]/[[6.UAR Seminar in Undergraduate Advanced Research | 6.UAR]]" requirements, you now get to choose two additional electives from the **EECS** list. The **CIM2** list has been expanded to include subjects that can also satisfy the **AUS2** requirement.

6-1 students who are double majoring in 8-flex may make the following substitutions to their 6-1 degree program:

- 8.03 in place of the intro subject
- 8.04 in place of 6.004
- 8.05 or 8.051 as one of their header subjects
