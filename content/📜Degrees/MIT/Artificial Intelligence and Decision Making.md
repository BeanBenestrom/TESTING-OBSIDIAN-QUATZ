<font style="color: grey">This major teaches students to develop techniques for the analysis and synthesis of systems that interact with an external world via perception, communication, and action, and that learn, make decisions and adapt in a changing environment. It integrates disciplines typically taught in different departments, including electrical engineering, computer science, statistics, operations research and brain and cognitive sciences</font>
