<font style="color: grey">Advanced undergraduate subject. Also see the **grad_AUS2** list below. A subject provides an AUS2 experience if at least 40% of the grade is based on new advanced EECS technical material that is rigorously evaluated through examinations and/or problem sets. An AUS2 subject must be at least 12 units, and its prerequisites should include an EECS subject at least at the foundation level, but ideally header or center level. It may be dual-numbered with a graduate subject, but must have distinct requirements to ensure accessibility to the range of undergraduate students in the department.</font>
